                    <li>½ pound ground beef </li>
                    <li>1 small onion, chopped </li>
                    <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce </li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups water </li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt </li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley </li>
                    <li>½ pinch dried basil </li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper </li>
                    <li>4 ounces uncooked spaghetti </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Steps to cook:</h4>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the onion until all pink is gone; drain.</li>
                    <li>Stir in tomato sauce, water, salt, parsley, basil and pepper; mix well. Heat until sauce boils. Break spaghetti in half and drop into sauce a little at a time. Cover and turn to low.</li>
                    <li>Cook until spaghetti is tender, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking to pan and from noodles sticking together. Add water, 1/2 to 1 cup, if it starts to dry out and noodles are not cooked.</li>
