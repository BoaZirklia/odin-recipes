# odin-recipes

Hello!

This little project I got from The Odin Project (theodinproject.com) where I currently learning from is a simple "recipe" website. This will help me test my understanding and how much I learned HTML and CSS codes. This project will also help me be familiarize with git and github.

Wish me luck!
